close-reason: Removed duplicate StaticStringMaps from agent.zig, now uses tool_categories.isSafe/isEdit/isQuiet
---

agent.zig:1986-2003,2875-2894 has quiet_tools, always_approve_tools, edit_tools StaticStringMaps that duplicate tool_categories.zig:11-37. Consolidate into tool_categories.zig and update agent.zig to use getFlags() API
