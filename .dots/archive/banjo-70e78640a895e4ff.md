File: src/core/engine.zig:315-331, 535-551 - Two functions differ only in which callback they call (sendText vs sendThought). Fix: Create generic sendEngineOutput(ctx, engine, text, callback_fn) that takes callback as parameter, or use comptime to generate both. Impact: Reduces code duplication in engine.
