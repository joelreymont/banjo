Files: engine.zig:41, codex_bridge.zig:11, mcp_server.zig:542, handler.zig:983 - Same 30_000ms timeout appears in 4+ places. Fix: Create src/core/constants.zig with default_rpc_timeout_ms, nudge_cooldown_ms, tool_request_timeout_ms. Update all files to import from there. Impact: Single source of truth, easier to tune timeouts.
